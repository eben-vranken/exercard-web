I'm very glad with the progress I've made. 😊<br><br>The previous sprint was mainly about creating decks and creating cards, but that was about it. Not very interesting for the user. This sprint included a lot more main ideas. 💡<ul><li>Implement SM-2 as the first SRS algorithm<li>Create front-end functionality for reviewing cards<li>Beautify the reviewing process using animations and styling<li>Create SSR blog (Which you are reading now!📝)</li></ul>At first I wanted to implement FSRS as the first algorithm, since I find it to be a much more modern alternative, but I ran into a lot of trouble actually understanding it (mainly the mathematical side) and after a couple of days concluded that for now I will implement SM-2 and before the alpha release of Exercard, dedicate an entire sprint to also including FSRS and turning it into the default algorithm used. (While still leaving SM-2 so that users can decide which algorithm they use)<br><br>Besides that, I'm very glad with how everything turned out.<br><br>I wish you all a happy 2025, I will see you next year<br><br>Eben</p>",
